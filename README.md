# notes.tomd.org

Self-hosted, gist-like markdown notes. Paste markdown, get a clean shareable
URL, optionally protect a note with a password.

Live at https://notes.tomd.org/.

## Features

- Single-user authoring (Django superuser), public/anonymous viewing
- Custom slugs or auto-generated 6-char base62 IDs (`notes.tomd.org/aB3kLm`)
- Optional per-note passwords, session-scoped unlock, with IP+slug rate limiting
- Live markdown preview in the editor (client-side `marked` + `DOMPurify` +
  Mermaid + Highlight.js); server-side `markdown` + `pygments` + `bleach` is
  canonical
- Mermaid diagrams from fenced `mermaid` code blocks
- Drag or paste images into the editor — Pillow re-encodes to WebP, caps the
  longest edge at 2000px, strips EXIF, and stores on the persistent volume
- Rendered images are wrapped in click-to-expand links
- Raw source view at `/<slug>/raw`
- Passkey (WebAuthn) auth alongside username/password, with RP ID hardcoded
  to `notes.tomd.org`
- Deployed on Coolify with SQLite on a persistent volume

## Local development

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
DEBUG=1 python manage.py migrate
DEBUG=1 python manage.py createsuperuser
DEBUG=1 python manage.py runserver
```

## Tests

```bash
python manage.py test notes
```

The test suite covers slug generation, markdown rendering + XSS sanitisation,
Mermaid fence detection (including CRLF-submitted textareas), the `Note`
model, public read views, URL-shadowing guards, auth-gated authoring,
password gating, rate limiting, editor markup, UI structure, the `Passkey`
model, both WebAuthn flows (register + login, with crypto verification
mocked), the `Image` model + cascade/signal cleanup, the upload endpoint
(auth + CSRF), the Pillow pipeline (resize, WebP, EXIF-stripping), upload
rejection (SVG / oversized / non-image), image→expand-link wrapping, the
orphan-image sweep command, bearer-token note creation, reading and updating,
idempotent API retries, and the bundled note-sharing skill clients.

## URL map

| Path | Who | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | authed | Dashboard (anonymous GET returns 404) |
| `/login/` | anon | Django login; also exposes passkey login |
| `/new/` | authed | Editor for a new note |
| `/api/v1/notes` | bearer token | POST JSON to create and share a note |
| `/api/v1/notes/<slug>` | bearer token | GET a note's Markdown and HTML; PATCH to change it |
| `/api/v1/notes/<slug>/comments[/<id>]` | bearer token | List, post and delete comments |
| `/upload/` | authed | POST-only image upload (multipart), returns JSON `{url, markdown}` |
| `/i/<short_id>.webp` | public | Serve a stored image |
| `/<slug>/` | public | Rendered note (password-gated if set) |
| `/<slug>/raw` | public | Markdown source (password-gated if set) |
| `/<slug>/edit/` | authed | Editor for existing note |
| `/<slug>/unlock/` | public | Password prompt |
| `/<slug>/delete/` | authed | POST-only delete |
| `/passkeys/` | authed | List + register passkeys |
| `/passkeys/register/{begin,finish}/` | authed | WebAuthn register ceremony |
| `/passkeys/login/{begin,finish}/` | anon | WebAuthn auth ceremony |
| `/passkeys/<pk>/delete/` | authed | POST-only delete a passkey |
| `/admin/` | authed | Django admin |

Slugs `admin`, `login`, `logout`, `new`, `static`, `favicon.ico`, `robots.txt`,
`healthz`, `_`, `api`, `i`, `upload` are reserved. `/passkeys/` is also
effectively reserved because the literal `/passkeys/` path is registered
before the `<slug>/` catch-all.

## Agent sharing API

`POST /api/v1/notes` creates a note using the same validation, Markdown
rendering, password hashing and slug generation as the browser editor. Tokens
are scoped, revocable, and stored as SHA-256 digests; the raw secret is shown
only when it is created.

Create a token in the environment whose database the API will use:

```sh
python manage.py create_note_api_token --username tom --name Codex
```

In production, run that command inside the running Coolify container using the
procedure under "Running a management command in prod" below. Store the
printed token in the agent's secret/environment configuration as
`NOTES_TOMD_TOKEN`; do not put it in this repository or in a skill file. Delete
the token in Django admin to revoke it.

Example request:

```sh
curl https://notes.tomd.org/api/v1/notes \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NOTES_TOMD_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: $(uuidgen)" \
  --data '{"title":"Example","markdown":"# Hello"}'
```

Accepted JSON fields are `markdown` (required), `title`, `slug`, `password`,
and `comments_enabled` (boolean, default false). A successful response
includes `url`, `raw_url`, timestamps, and whether the note is
password-protected and open to comments. Notes without a password are
accessible to anyone who has or discovers their URL. Requests default to a
1 MiB limit; override it with `NOTE_API_MAX_REQUEST_BYTES` if needed.

### Reading and updating notes

| Request | Scope | Does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/v1/notes/<slug>` | `notes:read` | Returns the note's settings plus its `markdown` source and rendered `html` |
| `PATCH /api/v1/notes/<slug>` | `notes:write` | Changes only the fields sent; returns the note as `GET` does |

Like the comments API, these act as the owner, so they ignore the note's
password. `PATCH` accepts `markdown`, `title` (`null` clears it), `slug`,
`comments_enabled`, `password` (sets a new one) and `clear_password: true`
(removes it). It validates through the same `NoteForm` as the editor. A blank
`slug` is refused, because it would give the note a new random URL. It has no
`Idempotency-Key` support, since repeating the same change has the same result.
Notes keep no revision history, so a client that replaces the Markdown should
keep the previous source itself.

```sh
curl -X PATCH https://notes.tomd.org/api/v1/notes/abc123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NOTES_TOMD_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"title":"Revised","comments_enabled":true}'
```

### Comments

| Request | Scope | Does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/v1/notes/<slug>/comments` | `comments:read` | Lists threads with nested `replies` and each thread's `anchor` |
| `POST /api/v1/notes/<slug>/comments` | `comments:write` | Posts a comment as the note's owner (`is_owner`, "author" badge) |
| `DELETE /api/v1/notes/<slug>/comments/<id>` | `comments:write` | Deletes a comment and its replies; returns 204 |

The token acts as the owner, so reads ignore the note's password and work even
when comments are switched off. Posting to a note with comments off returns
`409 comments_disabled`. `POST` accepts `body` (required), `parent` (id of a
top-level comment, for a reply), `author_name`, and the anchor fields `quote`,
`prefix`, `suffix`, `start_offset`; it honours `Idempotency-Key` like note
creation. A `quote` must be the words as rendered on the page, not Markdown
source. Anchors are resolved in the reader's browser, so the API only reports
`anchor.quote_in_note`: whether the quote currently appears verbatim in the
note's rendered text.

Tokens are created with `notes:create` only. Grant read, edit and comment
access when issuing a token, or to an existing one by its prefix (shown in
Django admin) without changing the secret:

```sh
python manage.py create_note_api_token --username tom --name Agent \
  --scopes "notes:create notes:read notes:write comments:read comments:write"
python manage.py set_note_api_token_scopes --prefix nt_AbCdEf123 \
  --scopes "notes:create notes:read notes:write comments:read comments:write"
```

The version-controlled personal skill is in `skills/share-notes/` and is also
installed at `~/.codex/skills/share-notes/` on this machine. It triggers only
on explicit sharing/publication requests and invokes its deterministic Python
client, which uses the API's idempotency support for safe retries. Its
`note_content` script reads and updates notes, and its `note_comments` script
lists, posts, replies to and deletes comments, through the endpoints above.

## Deployment

Deployed on [Coolify](https://admin.co.tomd.org). Pushes to `main` are built and
deployed automatically by Coolify's GitHub App. There is **no CI** — the old
Fly GitHub Action was removed when the site migrated off Fly, so nothing runs
the test suite on push; run `python manage.py test notes` locally first.

Manual deploy: the Coolify UI, or the `coolify` CLI. (It previously ran on Fly;
`fly.toml` remains in the repo but is unused.)

### Coolify configuration

- App `notes-tomd-org`, UUID `xok61kj0vasx16hv3xkv9qj9`, a single
  `dockerfile`-build container
- Persistent volume mounted at `/app/data`, SQLite DB at `/app/data/db.sqlite3`
- Uploaded images live alongside the DB at `/app/data/media/images/` —
  `MEDIA_ROOT` defaults to `dirname(DB_PATH)/media`, so setting `DB_PATH`
  pins the media dir onto the same volume automatically
- Migrations run inside the app container at startup via `entrypoint.sh`; keep
  them there (a build/release step that doesn't mount the volume would migrate
  an empty DB — see CLAUDE.md)
- `entrypoint.sh` also creates/updates the superuser idempotently from
  `DJANGO_SUPERUSER_*` env vars

### Required environment variables

Set in the Coolify app's Environment Variables (UI or `coolify app env`), then
restart the app:

- `SECRET_KEY` — Django secret key
- `DB_PATH` — `/app/data/db.sqlite3`
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS` — `notes.tomd.org,notes-tomd-org.co.tomd.org`
- `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` — `https://notes.tomd.org,https://notes-tomd-org.co.tomd.org`
- `DJANGO_SUPERUSER_USERNAME` / `DJANGO_SUPERUSER_EMAIL` / `DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`

### Running a management command in prod

Coolify's API can't exec ad-hoc commands, so SSH the host and `docker exec`. The
container name is `<uuid>-<digits>` and changes each deploy, so resolve it first:

```sh
ssh root@admin.co.tomd.org \
  "docker exec \$(docker ps --format '{{.Names}}' | grep xok61kj0vasx16hv3xkv9qj9) \
     python manage.py <command>"
```

e.g. `rerender_notes` re-renders every note's stored HTML after a rendering
change (`--dry-run` to preview the count).

Optional image-tuning overrides (defaults fine for most cases):
`MEDIA_ROOT`, `IMAGE_MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` (default 10 MB),
`IMAGE_MAX_DIMENSION` (default 2000 px), `IMAGE_WEBP_QUALITY` (default 85).
The agent note API also accepts `NOTE_API_MAX_REQUEST_BYTES` (default 1 MiB).

### TODO: schedule the orphan-image sweep

Uploads that never get referenced by a saved note are left with `note IS NULL`
and swept by a management command:

```
python manage.py sweep_orphan_images           # deletes orphans older than 24h
python manage.py sweep_orphan_images --hours 1 # shorter threshold
python manage.py sweep_orphan_images --dry-run # report only
```

Currently this has to be run manually. Wire it up as a Coolify scheduled task
(daily, command `python manage.py sweep_orphan_images`, container field blank
for this single-container app) so the volume doesn't slowly accumulate dead
uploads. A note-delete already cascades its images, so the sweep only handles
the "uploaded but never saved" case.

## Project layout

## Security notes

- Bleach allowlists safe tags/attrs after markdown rendering; `<script>` /
  `<style>` bodies are stripped pre-bleach. `javascript:` and other non-safe
  protocols are filtered.
- Links get `rel="nofollow noopener"` via a bleach linker callback.
- Password hashes use Django's `make_password`/`check_password`; raw values
  never stored.
- Note API bearer tokens are high-entropy, stored only as SHA-256 digests,
  scoped (`notes:create`, `notes:read`, `notes:write`, `comments:read`,
  `comments:write`; note creation only by default), revocable, and never
  accepted from query strings.
- Unlock throttle: 3 wrong attempts per `(IP, slug, minute)` → 429.
- WebAuthn RP ID is hardcoded to `notes.tomd.org` in `noteserver/settings.py`
  — passkeys registered in prod will not work against any other hostname
  (including the Coolify alt domain `notes-tomd-org.co.tomd.org`).
- Image uploads are validated by Pillow's decoder (not by `Content-Type` or
  filename), re-encoded to WebP, and size-capped; SVG is explicitly rejected
  because bleach does not sanitise image bodies. Re-encoding strips EXIF.
